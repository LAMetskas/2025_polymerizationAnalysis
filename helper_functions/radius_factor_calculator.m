function [] = radius_factor_calculator()
% This function calculates what size the radius_factor input to linkages.m
% should be to maximize the search cylinder size while disallowing multiple
% multiple monomers in the search cylinder. Two non-overlapping monomers
% will be too large for both to be detected inside the resulting search 
% cylinder. The user inputs two other parameters of the search cylinder, 
% then this function chooses the radius_factor. User should use the output 
% plot of link_arc_analysis.m to choose the other 2 values.
