function [] = rubisco_alignment_analysis(carboxysome_data, max_angle, max_distance, min_inner_conc)
% This function generates a graph showing the relationship between the
% number of aligned rubiscos in a carboxysome and the parameters of the
% carboxysome. Specifically, carboxysome volume, total concentration, and
% inner concentration are relevant values of the data points. A pair of
% rubiscos are "aligned" if they pass all filters specified by the user.
%
% Inputs
% carboxysome_data - an array of carboxysome objects filled with data
%                    through at least local_global_alignment.m
% max_angle - the maximum angle to allow between aligned rubiscos (degrees)
% max_distance - the maximum distance to allow between aligned rubiscos
%                (pixels, recommended to use the same value as in 
%                local_global_alignment.m)
% min_inner_conc - the minimum inner concentration of a carboxysome to
%                  allow on the plot (micro molar)
